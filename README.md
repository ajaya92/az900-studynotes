## What is cloud computing?
 - Resources consuming on demand as utility e.g. VMs, storage
 - Delivery of computing services over the Internet
 - No need to maintain own infrastructure
## Advantages
- Faster innovation
- Rapid elasticity (flexible resources)
- Pay-as-you-need
- Reliability
- Economies of scale

## Cloud benefits
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78084580/121568955-a60deb80-c9f6-11eb-8bb8-80b80f25861a.png)

## Types of cloud computing services: how much you manage vs how much cloud vendor manages
 - Infrastructure as a service: pay-as-you-go, infrastructure building (renting servers, VMs, storage, networks)
 - Platform as a service: environment for building, testing and deploying software applications, without focus on managing underlying infrastructure
 - Software as a service: users connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet

- SaaS: access to sophisticated applications

## CC Deployment Models
- Public Cloud: hardware shared between clients, Azure, Office 365
- Private Cloud: Azure Stack, looks like **data center model**, hardware used by a single company (company responsible), no access to users outside of the organization
- Hybrid Cloud (public + private w/ orchestration): Azure Stack
- Community Cloud: governments, Azure Government, Germany, China

## Azure Concepts
### Azure Data Centers
- 160+ Azure data centers around the world
- 150+ edge locations: smaller data centers, caching (Azure CDN)
- Organized into regions: multiple data centers within regions to help with failover (fault tolerance) and high availability
- Economy of scale: no costs related to hardware and infrastructure management
- Datacenter security
	- You don't know the specific locations of each data center
	- Access control: prior approval and justification
	- Physical security, security guards, biometric identification
	- Complies with standards and regulations: ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRamp, SOC 1&2
	- Region-specific standards: Australia, UK
	- Virtual security: data encryption, separate from data of other customers
	- Redundancy: data stored three times within the data center, possible to expand to other data centers (disaster recovery)
	- Security professionals dedicated to keep customer data and applications safe
- Energy efficiency
	- Data centers are carbon neutral since 2012
	- Renewable energy certificates
	- 100% renewable energy by 2025
	- Solar, wind and hydropower 
	- Research and experimenting
### Azure Regions: physical location of a data center or multiple data centers
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78084580/115070752-bc526c00-9ecb-11eb-97d1-f5ff42361c6c.png)
- Choices affect performance and availability of data: high availability and disaster recovery
- Not all services are available in all regions
	- Some services do not require specific region
	- Regions may have regulatory and compliance rules: data residency
	- Azure Geographies: contains one or more regions
		- Used to meet data residency and compliance requirements
		- Single country or set of countries
	- Availability Sets: keep applications online during maintenance or hardware failure
		- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78084580/121571983-12d6b500-c9fa-11eb-890a-0bc0c22fdef1.png)
		- Update domains (UD): scheduled maintenance, performance or security updates are sequenced through update domains
		- Fault domains (FD): physical separation of workloads across different hardware in a datacenter
	- Availability Zones: unique physical locations within a single region
		- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78084580/121572347-74971f00-c9fa-11eb-94e2-6a5d4d6b502c.png)
		- One or more data centers equipped with independent power, cooling and networking
		- Not available in every region: some regions may contain one data center only. When availability zones are available, there's a minimum of three separate zones
		- Some services may replicate data between availability zones automatically
		- Connected through private fiber-optic networks
	- Region Pairs: data centers located 300+ miles, main goal to reduce impact on availability
		- Configuration of automatic replication and failover for some services
		- High availability: service updates for one region at one time
		- Outage recover prioritization: at least one region in each pair will be prioritized for disaster recovery
		- Updates rolled out sequentially to minimize downtime
		- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78084580/121571535-8926e780-c9f9-11eb-8317-6d64a215e1d6.png)

### Azure Resource Groups: logical containers to manage and aggregate resources in a single unit
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78084580/121572665-ccce2100-c9fa-11eb-9b91-ece3076f6c3e.png)

- Resources in a resource group can communicate with resources in other resource groups
- Resources can be in different regions
- Resource group can be created in a different region than the resources in the group
- If a resource needs to exist on a different deployment cycle, it should be in another resource group
- Security controls for administrative actions: roles in the team do not have full control to every resource
- Can export infrastructure-as-code using resource manager templates
	- Azure Resource Manager: management layer tha enables creation, update and deletion of resourcesn in a Azure subscription
		- Accessed by many tools such as Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST interfaces
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78084580/115070799-caa08800-9ecb-11eb-96c1-20ede4182b77.png)
	- Azure Subscription: authenticated and authorized access to Azure accounts
